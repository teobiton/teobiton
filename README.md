👋 I’m @teobiton, hardware design and verification engineer, currently pursuing a PhD in hardware security. I'm exporting most of my projetcs on GitHub. 

💡 I am here to learn more about git and to use if for my projects.

💾 My favorite subjects are microarchitecture design, embedded system design, hardware security and cryptography. I like using innovative software in my projects.

📭 You can contact me by email at tbiton@proton.me.
