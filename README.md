ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @teobiton, electronics engineering student. I'm exporting most of my school projetcs on GitHub. 

ðŸ’¡ I am here to learn more about git and to use if for my projects.

ðŸ’¾ My favorite subjects are microarchitecture conception, embedded system design and Hardware security. I like using innovative software in my projects. I am looking for Open source projects to participate in.

ðŸ“­ You can contact me by email at teo.biton@gmail.com.
